Welcome to my GitHub account! I am a UCR computer science student and [NOAA EPP/MSI](https://www.noaa.gov/office-education/epp-msi) scholar focused on data science and machine learning. I currently work as an engineer for UCR's [EcoCar](https://ecocar.engr.ucr.edu/) project. This work involves building Vehicle to Everything (V2X) systems that allow self-driving vehicle algorithms to communicate in real-time. Much of my project experience cannot be publicly displayed due to NDA/Clearence, this GitHub is for my personal projects/contributions. 



My personal projects include:

- C++ Networking and Multithreading (InternetChatRoom)
- Data collection libraries (simple_noaa) (NBA-Webscraper) (Weather-Forecast-Web-Scraper)
- Dataset creation for use in machine learning models (wildfire_dataset_creation) (survey_data_creation)
- Data analysis for insight and prospecting data for modeling (survey_data_analysis)
- Data manipulation for increasing the utility of datasets (Hurricane-Data-Conversion-Method) (survey_data_creation)
- Exploring the use cases of classical machine learning models (titanic_machine_learning_model)
- Backend applications for transfer of data (testAPI) (hate_detection_scraper)


Please feel free to take a look around and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for future projects. Thank you for visiting!
