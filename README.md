# Welcome to My GitHub!  

Hi, I'm Devin R. Shaw, a Computer Science student at UC Riverside and a [NOAA EPP/MSI](https://www.noaa.gov/office-education/epp-msi) scholar. I specialize in backend/database applications, and research based development. My work spans machine learning, system programming, and algorithm optimization.  

## üîß Skills & Interests  
- **Programming:** Python, Java, C++, Rust, Scala, SQL, MATLAB  
- **Tech Stack:** Django, PostgreSQL, Hadoop, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn  
- **Focus Areas:** Backend Development, Data Science, Compiler Design, ML Optimization  

## üèóÔ∏è Notable Projects  
- **Magnetic Anomaly Prediction** ‚Äì Built ML models to improve navigation accuracy using random forest regression trained on geophysical data.  
- **Teh Terik Compiler** ‚Äì Developing a toy language compiler in Rust with error handling and code generation. Includes test suites for each phase.  
- **Terminal Chat Room (C++)** ‚Äì Implemented networking and multithreading for real-time messaging on a Linux server via the command line.  
- **NOAA API Wrapper(simple_noaa) (Python)** ‚Äì Created `simple_noaa`, a Python library that streamlines access to NOAA datasets for data aggregation. 
- **Wildfire Local Climate Data Creation** ‚Äì Developed a fire climate dataset from NOAA API data for machine learning applications.  
- **Java/SQL Delivery Application** ‚Äì A Java and SQL-based pizza ordering system with full database integration and documented SQL operations.  
- **Royal Flushers Game (C#)** ‚Äì A 2D top-down shooter with poker hand combo mechanics. Features enemy pathfinding, poker hand ranking system and uses coroutines. Escape the casino after winning too much‚Äîbefore security catches you!
