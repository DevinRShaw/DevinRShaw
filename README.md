Welcome to my GitHub account! I am a computer science student with a passion for data and machine learning. On this account, you will find a variety of projects I have worked on related to these topics. I ease of developemnt with python and its libraries so most projects here are written in that but I am open to contributing to projects in any language.

My projects include:

- Data collection libraries for dataset creation (simple_noaa)
- Data analysis and visualization using tools such as Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries
- Dataset creation for use in models built using frameworks such as scikit-learn (wildfire_dataset_creation)
- Please feel free to take a look around and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for future projects. Thank you for visiting!
