# Hi, I'm Devin R. Shaw 👋

**Software Engineer | UC Riverside CS '25 | LLNL Co-op**

I'm most interested in the areas of systems, performance and concurrency / parallelism. I want to grow as an engineer in a role that not only requires correctness of computation, but also emphasizes speed and efficent resource use at scale. 

Two of my favorite projects to show off are my games. Checkout their READMEs to see some gameplay.

## Featured Projects

### Backend / Machine Learning / Data Engineering
- **[Magnetic Anomaly Prediction (Python)](https://github.com/DevinRShaw/MagneticAnomalyPrediction)** – Random forest regression model improving crustal magnetic field mapping accuracy for MagNav navigation systems.
