# Hi, I'm Devin R. Shaw 👋

**Software Engineer | UC Riverside CS '25 | LLNL Co-op**

I'm passionate about building high-performance systems that prioritize speed, scale, and simplicity. Currently optimizing image-processing pipelines at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where I reduced computation time by 98% through parallelization and efficient system design.

## 🚀 What I Do

I specialize in building robust, scalable software systems with a focus on:
- **High-Performance Computing** – Parallel processing, concurrency, and optimization
- **Backend Development** – Server design, networking protocols, and distributed systems
- **Machine Learning Engineering** – Production ML pipelines and data-driven solutions

## 💼 Professional Experience
