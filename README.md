Welcome to my GitHub account! I am a UCR computer/data science student and NOAA EPP/MSI scholar currently building applications for data science and machine learning. On this account, you will find a variety of projects I have worked on related to these topics. I enjoy the ease of development with python and the notebook style of development so most projects here are written in pythonjupyter, but I am open to contributing to projects in other languages.

My projects include:

- Data collection libraries (simple_noaa) (NBA-Webscraper) (Weather-Forecast-Web-Scraper)
- Dataset creation for use in machine learning models (wildfire_dataset_creation) (survey_data_creation)
- Data analysis for insight and prospecting data for modeling (survey_data_analysis)
- Data manipulation for increasing utility of datasets (Hurricane-Data-Conversion-Method) (survey_data_creation)
- Exploring the use cases of classical machine learning models (titanic_machine_learning_model)
- Backend applications for transfer of data (testAPI) (hate_detection_scraper)


Please feel free to take a look around and let me know if you have any questions or suggestions for future projects. Thank you for visiting!
