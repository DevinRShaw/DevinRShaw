# Hi, I'm Devin R. Shaw 👋

**Software Engineer | UC Riverside CS '25 | LLNL Co-op**

I'm most interested in creating solutions to problems where performance and concurrency are important. I want to grow as an engineer in a role that not only requires correctness of computation, but also places constraints on speed and the resources available. 

Two of my favorite projects to show off are my games. Checkout their READMEs to see some gameplay.

## Featured Projects

### Game Development
- **[Heart's Bid (C#/Unity)](https://github.com/DevinRShaw/Poker-Hand-2D-Combat-Game)** – 2D poker-combat shooter with hand-ranking mechanics and enemy AI pathfinding. [Play in browser →](https://nikohnoo.itch.io/hearts-bid)
- **[Flappy Bird AVR Clone](https://github.com/DevinRShaw/Clicky-Bird-Embedded-AVR-Game)** – Real-time embedded game on bare-metal ATmega328P with custom interrupt-driven scheduler. Optimized memory usage by 99.6% through efficient rendering algorithms within 2KB RAM constraint.

### Networking 
- **[TCP Chat Room (C++)](https://github.com/DevinRShaw/TerminalChatRoom)** – Multi-threaded client-server chatroom with authentication, admin privileges, and persistent logging.
- **[Reddit Search Engine](https://github.com/DevinRShaw/RedditSearchEngine)** – Multi-threaded web crawler with PyLucene indexing and Flask interface for fast, distributed search.

### Machine Learning & Data Engineering
- **[Magnetic Anomaly Prediction (Python)](https://github.com/DevinRShaw/MagneticAnomalyPrediction)** – Random forest regression model improving crustal magnetic field mapping accuracy for MagNav navigation systems.
- **[Ocular Disease Recognition](https://github.com/DevinRShaw/Ocular-Disease-Recognition-)** – Apache Spark ML pipeline on AWS EC2 cluster with MySQL backend and Flask deployment for real-time predictions.
- **[Delivery Database System](https://github.com/DevinRShaw/Ocular-Disease-Recognition-)** –  Role-based backend schema defining Users, Items, Orders, and Stores with permission controls and order lifecycle management.
