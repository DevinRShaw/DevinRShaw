# Hi, I'm Devin R. Shaw 👋

**Software Engineer | UC Riverside CS '25 | LLNL Co-op**

I'm most interested in creating solution to problems where performance and concurrency are used to solve difficult problems. Not only what to do with our resources but how to do it given a scenario. Problems that not only require correctness of computation, but also place constraints on speed and the resources available to the software are where I want to grow as an engineer. 

My favorite personal projects have been the games I developed, both of which have gameplay featured in their README files. Although I am not interested in game development as a career, it is a fun practice and playing them is a reward.

## 🎯 Featured Projects

### Game Development
- **[Heart's Bid (C#/Unity)](https://github.com/DevinRShaw/Poker-Hand-2D-Combat-Game)** – 2D poker-combat shooter with hand-ranking mechanics and enemy AI pathfinding. [Play in browser →](https://nikohnoo.itch.io/hearts-bid)
- **[Flappy Bird AVR Clone](https://github.com/DevinRShaw/Clicky-Bird-Embedded-AVR-Game)** – Real-time embedded game on bare-metal ATmega328P with custom interrupt-driven scheduler. Optimized memory usage by 99.6% through efficient rendering algorithms within 2KB RAM constraint.

### Networking 
- **[TCP Chat Room (C++)](https://github.com/DevinRShaw/TerminalChatRoom)** – Multi-threaded client-server chatroom with authentication, admin privileges, and persistent logging.
- **[DHCP Server (Python)](link)** – Multi-threaded DHCP implementation with lease management, intelligent IP allocation, and thread-safe concurrency controls.
- **[Reddit Search Engine](https://github.com/DevinRShaw/RedditSearchEngine)** – Multi-threaded web crawler with PyLucene indexing and Flask interface for fast, distributed search.

### Machine Learning & Data Engineering
- **[Magnetic Anomaly Prediction (Python)](https://github.com/DevinRShaw/MagneticAnomalyPrediction)** – Random forest regression model improving crustal magnetic field mapping accuracy for MagNav navigation systems.
- **[Ocular Disease Recognition](https://github.com/DevinRShaw/Ocular-Disease-Recognition-)** – Apache Spark ML pipeline on AWS EC2 cluster with MySQL backend and Flask deployment for real-time predictions.
