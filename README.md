# Hi, I'm Devin R. Shaw 👋

**Software Engineer | UC Riverside CS '25 | LLNL Co-op**

I'm passionate about building high-performance systems that prioritize speed, scale, and simplicity. Most recently at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, I optimized image-processing pipelines, reducing computation time by 98% through parallelization and productionized scientific software packages enabling researchers to deploy and use our tools in production environments.
