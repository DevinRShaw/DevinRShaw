# Welcome to My GitHub!  

Hi, I'm Devin R. Shaw, a Computer Science student at UC Riverside and a Lawrence Livermore National Labratory NIF work-study. 

I currently work on high-throughput image processing software @ LLNL. Anything relating to larIn my education and projects I am focused on parallel/concurrent programming, networks, OS and optimization as a whole. 



## 🔧 Skills & Interests  
- **Programming:** Python, C++, SQL, MATLAB, C#
- **Tech Stack:** Flask, MySQL, Hadoop, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Unity, Spark
- **Focus Areas:** Backend Development, Data Science, Software Engineering, Concurrency/Parallel, Optimization 

## 🏗️ Notable Personal Projects  
- **Magnetic Anomaly Prediction (Python)** – Built ML models to improve navigation accuracy using random forest regression trained on geophysical data.
- **Heart's Bid Game (C#)** – A 2D top-down shooter with poker hand combo mechanics. Features enemy pathfinding, poker hand ranking system and uses coroutines. Escape the casino after winning too much—before security catches you!
- **Custom Compiler (Rust)** – Developed a toy language compiler front end in Rust with error handling and code generation. Includes test suites for each phase.
- **Terminal Chat Room (C++)** – Implemented networking and multithreading for real-time messaging on a Linux server via the command line. Features user authenticaiton, admin accounts and logging.
- **Async Terminal Chat Room (C)** - Built an event-driven server using epoll with uthash for fast client lookup by ID and username, supporting non-blocking I/O, unique user management, and efficient connection handling.
- **simple_noaa (Python)** - A library that streamlines access to the NOAA dataset API with functions that utilize date and time.
